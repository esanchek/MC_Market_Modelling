The files for reproducing the results presented in the paper: Sanchez-Karhunen, E., &amp; Valencia-Cabrera, L. (2019). Modelling complex market interactions using PDP systems. Journal of Membrane Computing, 1(1), 40–51. https://doi.org/10.1007/s41965-019-00008-z

In the paper we propose a membrane computing solution based on population dynamics P systems for a two version ot the classical producer-retailer problem. In the simpler model, the results described by Gh. and R. Păun are reproduced. We proposed an enriched version of that problem, closer to reality, that takes into account several economic
issues not considered in the initial model, including: depreciation of production capacity, decision mechanism to increase
manufacturing capability, dividends payment and costs associated to production factors. 

The model has been simulated making use of the framework provided by P-Lingua and MeCoSim and it is delivered a custom application based on them to reproduce the virtual experiments.

## Requirements

  * MeCoSim http://www.p-lingua.org/mecosim/
  * Java 1.8 (included in Path) https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html

## Usage

Load in MeCoSim the .xls (configuration file) and set the path for .pli (p-lingua file) and .ec2 (data model).
